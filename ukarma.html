                    <strong> KARMA </strong>
           Means we have to do 
          the work, not concentrate on the result</h5>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <br>   
                <p class="fst-italic">For students from a Madrasa background, the current scenario is not much 
                    satisfactory because of many prevalent <br> 
                    social constraints like strong superstitions 
                    and norms which hinder their path of improvement, so what do you have to give 
                    them any advice?</p>

                    <p>I think the sentence is negatively 
                      cannoted. There are ample opportunities and a positive atmosphere for 
                      persons coming from Madrasa. It is 
                      what they lack and their hindrance is 
                      lack of foundational knowledge. So, 
                      if they are equipped with foundational knowledge like current affairs, 
                      social science, and the subjects like 
                      applied science, mathematics, and 
                      English, they have all the chances. 
                      Because for getting any service or any 
                      achievements, you need two things. 
                      One is the skill. You can get the skill 
                      from coaching institutes or any other 
                      institutes that prepare the students. <br> 
                      But the second most important 
                      thing is the will. The will you have 
                      to get from your own mind based 
                      on your experience and your willpower. So that willpower, it is there 
                      in all mothers of students. So, if he 
                      is equipped with the skill, he has already so much positives. So, if we 
                      are giveing the needed foundational 
                      skills in the subject which is needed 
                      for civil service, he has enough opportunities to excel in the exams and 
                      a lso in the services.</p>

                      <p>You told about superstitious beliefs also. But I can easily tell that superstitious beliefs are also created 
                        by the persons who are produced 
                        from Madrasas. So, the age is changing and the time is changing. There 
                        are new challenges, there are new 
                        possibilities. So even the Madrasa 
                        students have to change and update 
                        with the given knowledge and they 
                        have to be updated with the current 
                        challenges. <br>
                        So, they have to come up from 
                        their traditional mindset that they 
                        are enough with these things and 
                        they have to overcome because they 
                        are first-generation educationalists, 
                        especially from their families. So, 
                        they have a double burden. First, 
                        they have to make their family or the 
                        system educated and second, they 
                        have to be updated themselves. So, 
                        both of these works should go simultaneously. But in my experience, it is 
                        sure that if the students are ready to 
                        update themselves, the system will 
                        automatically change us.</p>

                        <p class="fst-italic">owadays, there is an increasing tendency of suicides from students for many 
                          reasons especially due to failures in exams like SSLC. <br>   As for your experience, 
                          you got your dream after five successive 
                          failures in preliminary. Frankly, what do 
                          think failure is a great obstacle in front of 
                          success?</p>

                          <p>The fail means the first attempt at 
                            learning. If you fail, means you are 
                            failing in your strategies or you are 
                            failing in your operational methods. 
                            So, you have to change your strategy, 
                            not your goal. If you are not getting 
                            selected for your goal, then you have 
                            to change your vehicle. You have to 
                            check the fuel efficiency of your vehicle sometimes you have to change 
your vehicle also, but not the goal. 
So, the goal should be destined. It 
should be fixed before the time it 
means. It is the Niyyah. We are from 
a Madrasa background. We all are 
studying that Innamal A’maalu Binniyyah. So Niyyah should be the backbone. It should be strong. It should 
be fundamental, then everything will follow. And, in my case, it is nothing to be loose, and all the skies are 
there to get. <br>
So if you have nothing 
to lose, then it is clear that you can 
go all around the way. Failure, success, it is nothing. And secondly, if 
you fail, it means you have failed in 
the preparation, not in the result. You 
may have seen the theory of karma. 
That means we have to do the work, 
not concentrate on the result. Results
</p>
<p>may come, and they may be positive 
  or negative, but we should not be 
  fail in our preparation, in our operational modest modus operandi, or in 
  our work efforts. We should be consistent, there should have positive 
  mind consistency, and perseverance 
  should not concentrate on the result. 
  We have to do our work. The rest of 
  everything is based on god’s perception, man proposes, which God disposes.</p>
  <p class="fst-italic">Being a Madrasa teacher for 2000 monthly salary, you have taken more effort in 
    your preparatory period of UPSC. <br> So, 
    what was your motive to keep in Madrasa teaching even though you have to meet 
    huge expenses in your journey?</p>

    <p>Actually, for UPSC preparation, 
      there are two methods. One is the 
      expensive methods. You can go to a 
      high-level coaching institute in Delhi or some other places and you can 
      get all the things capsuled for your 
      life. In Delhi, Rajendra Nagar, there 
      are thousands of institutes. They 
      are charging high levels for their 
      coaching. Very expensive coaching. 
      It is easy that you can go there and 
      crack it. But other methods are very 
      cheap. You can get coaching from 
      YouTube without any cost. You can 
      get NCERT books and read them. It 
      costs nothing. You can go to some 
      philanthropic coaching institutes and 
      get it done. So, both ways are possible. As my financial background is 
      very low. My option was the second. 
      So, there were so much of problems 
      with selecting that. But it was sure 
      it is also possible. I studied only in 
      the free coaching, except for very 
      few incidents. All of them were free 
      coaching. Like Ponnani Saint Service 
      Institute, Morena national Urdu university, and Azad coaching institute. 
      All of them were free coaching. MSF 
      free Coaching Initiative Scholarship 
      Program. Shihab Thangal Coaching 
      Programme. Everything was very free 
      cost. So, it is also possible.</p>

      <p>And secondly, the Madrasa gave 
        me a wonderful opportunity to do 
        my earnings for my own existence, 
        which means we need food and accommodation. That was possible in 
        the Madrasa. And it gave us even if 
        it was 2000, it will give us the basic 
        income for our traveling. So when I 
        was doing coaching in Kozhikode, I 
        selected a Madrasa in Kozhikode. It 
        gave me the opportunity for my food 
        and accommodation. When I was in 
        Trivandrum, I got it in Trivandrum itself. When I was in Kanur, I got it in 
        Kannur also. So rather than a hindrance, it was a good opportunity for 
        our existence and survival.</p>

        <p class="fst-italic">Mathematics is a huge challenge in front 
          of many students, especially for UPSC 
          preparators Once you also said you were 
          weak in mathematics. So how you have 
          dealt with it? Have you ever faced any 
          problems with inefficiency in Mathematics? Any advice from your side for those 
          struggling with Mathematics?</p>

          <p>Mathematics is a huge challenge, 
            especially for persons coming from 
            the humanities background and for 
            the persons coming from a Madrasa 
            background. The recent CSAT question pattern is also tremendously 
            changing. They are giving maximum 
            focus on the tough mathematics. So 
            previously it was okay with the simple mathematics, but recently the 
            pattern has changed.
            <br>
            They need a higher level of mathematics and it is not also possible to 
            pass the CSAT paper only in English 
            it was not possible. So for mathematics, we need two types of mathematics also first the ways and means 
            of mathematics which tought in the 
            NCERT text book of mathematics, 
            and second the competitive mathematics. So, for the students who are 
            coming from Madrasas, I think I suggest they have to get basic mathematics from YouTube, especially on 
            the topics, the ten topics the UPSC 
            is covering. Moreover, rather than the 
            basic mathematics, they have to get 
            the previous question papers and 
            get it practiced several times to get 
            a hint of mathematics and again they 
            have to get a correct classroom for 
            the mathematics. Now it is available 
            online also. So in conclusion, I can 
            tell that whether you like it or not, 
            mathematics is an inevitable part, it is 
            not optional, it is compulsory. <br>   So we 
            have to change our mindset toward 
            mathematics. We also know that the time has changed with the mathematics. The new demanding courses like artificial intelligence or data 
            learning, and machine learning. Everything is based upon Mathematics. 
            Even software engineering courses 
            are based on Mathematics. So without Mathematics, we can’t go to the 
            current opportunities, high-earning 
            opportunities in the tech or IT field. 
            So mathematics is compulsory. So 
            as a student, we need to change our 
            mindset. We have to get the Mathematics done. Mathematics is not that 
            much difficult as Mantic or Akeda. It 
            is also an easy subject. But we have 
            to give maximum interest, curiosity, 
            and excitement towards Mathematics. Then it is easy to capture.
            And it is sure that we will get 100 
            percentage marks only in Mathematics. We will not get 100 percentage 
            marks in social sciences. So, if you 
            know the formula, if you know the 
            way, you will get full marks. So, the 
            opportunity is there, and we must 
            crack it at any cost. And the committees of Madrasas also should focus 
            on basic mathematics inculcating 
            mathematical abilities to students. 
            Then automatically things will be 
            cleared</p>

            <p class="fst-italic">According to you, in your early stages, 
              you had to get ridden the dream of being a 
              civil servant desperate for continuous failure and heavy family burden, and entered 
              some PSC training classes. But immediately, you stepped back into civil service 
              again. What did the incubating factor for 
              this come back?</p>

              <p>It was God’s plan or Allah’s plan 
                because I think some of the divine 
                things happened at that time, I was 
                very eagerly waiting or praying for 
                getting into service at least to get 
                prelims cleared. I tried a lot, but due 
                to the mathematical paper I was in 
                complete disarray, and I failed consecutively. I tried at least three or 
                four institutes to get the Mathematics paper cleared.
                But ultimately, what happened after I passed from one institute to another, I realized that it is not possible 
                to get things cleared, because that 
                time the paper was different. That 
                time there are two papers, the first is 
                GK, and the second was CSAT for the 
                prelims and we have to get the marks 
                and it was calculated combinedly. 
                So, we have to get at least half of the 
                marks from both papers. So it was 
                not possible for a person who is very 
                weak in mathematics and ultimately, I decided that it is not possible to 
                me to pass Mathematics and I withdrew from the competition. <br> I joined 
                another PSC-level institute to get a 
                government job. But after one or two 
                months the new government came 
                and the decision appeared that the 
                second paper pattern is changed. 
                We have to get only 33 percentage marks in the second paper and 
                at that time Mathematics was very 
                easy. So, when I read that decision 
                in the newspaper, I decided that the 
                time has come in my way. Sometimes 
                the system changes to our desires If 
                you desire hardly, the universe will 
                change for that. So that thing hap-
                pened and I came back again to the 
                competition.</p>
                <p class="fst-italic">Besides continuous failures in your career, questions from people are more 
                  heart-touching, so what about your experience? How you could tackle those hurting questions?</p>
                  <p>It is very correct that sometimes 
                    we can survive. But society will not 
                    allow you to survive. Because society 
                    always follows easy methods, shortcuts, and the average things.
                    But for getting excellent or extraordinary things you have to do extraordinary things. The extraordinary 
                    results will not be created in ordinary ways, they will be created only 
                    in extraordinary ways. So, you must 
                    do extraordinary things continuously 
                    to get the excellent result. But society is not ready or equipped for that, 
                    first thing they are not literate on the 
                    basics of civil service. Usually, they 
                    understand that it is a course, a certificate, or a year-based thing. So, we 
                    have to make society first literate on 
                    that thing, especially at that time. But 
                    I think in the end it is an experience. 
                    We have to take it in a sportsman 
                    spirit. Whatever the questions come 
                    from the society it is the best toolkit 
                    or study material. We will not get it 
                    in any other textbook. So, if we are 
                    okay with that in that textbook if we 
                    are okay with them, then everything 
                    will be easier. So rather than textbooks, society is the best textbook 
                    for UPSC.</p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">As I heard, you were dismissed from your 
                      college, but interestingly you won the prelims in the same year. <br> Would you please 
                      describe the moment after becoming the 
                      first ever to win prelims from your institution?</p>
                      <p>Yes, it was happened when I was 
                        studying at Molana National Azad 
                        Urdu University. Minority coaching 
                        cell. But it was a minor issue of management that they expelled me telling me the reason for the shortage of 
                        attendance. But they were not aware 
                        that attendance is not mandatory 
                        for UPSC it is the self-studying and 
                        practicing question paper. Using the 
                        library is most important.
                        So, I was not a fresher there and 
                        their management is insisting on the 
                        classroom. Studies and attendance. 
                        And I was not happy with that. That’s 
                        why they expelled it. But out of 120, 
                        only one person cracked up prelims. <br>
                        It was the problem with the management and the persons in the governance of the coaching institute. They 
                        are coming from an academic background.
                        They have some Ph.Ds or PGs but 
                        they are not aware of the ABCD of 
                        coaching. It happens in some institutes, but for every institute, we can 
                        tell that one is the academic atmosphere and the second is the peer 
                        group pressure. Both these things are 
                        very important than the attendance 
                        for getting cleared.</p>
