                    The Islamic Golden Age, 
                    spanning from the 7th to the 
                    13th century, was a period 
                    of significant advancements in the 
                    economic, cultural, and educational fields in Islamic countries. During 
                    this time, the Umayyad dynasty was 
                    under pressure internally, leading to 
                    revolutions led by Arab Abu Al Abbas. With the support of his followers, the Umayyad dynasty was destroyed, and the Abbasid caliphate 
                    was established in its place.
                    One of the most important cities during this period was Baghdad, 
                    which was built by Abbasid leaders. 
                    Situated near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, Baghdad became a vital 
                    area for food production and trade 
                    activities between Europe and Asia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The city was known for its beauty, 
                    with numerous parks, gardens, and 
                    bazaars. The palace of the caliphs 
                    was a major attraction in Baghdad.
                    The Abbasid caliphs had a keen interest in knowledge and established 
                    the House of Wisdom in Baghdad 
                    to promote education. This institution attracted scholars from various 
                    countries and religions, including 
                    STUDY
                    Muslims, Christians, and Jews. The 
                    translation movement played a significant role in educational progress 
                    during this time. Greek works, such 
                    as those by Aristotle, were translated into Arabic to spread philosophy, 
                    science, and medicinal thoughts. The 
                    translations were carried out by both 
                    Muslim and Christian scholars</p>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                 The Abbasid dynasty also borrowed printing technology from Chinese scientists after a battle against 
the Tang dynasty. This secret method was brought back to Islamic 
countries by forcing Chinese printers 
to reproduce it. The establishment 
of paper mills further facilitated the 
spread of knowledge, and Europeans eventually learned this technique from Arabs. Prominent Islamic 
scholars emerged during this period, 
including Ibn Rushd from Spain. He 
was a master of Aristotelian philosophy, Islamic theology, and politics. 
His philosophical works, known as 
Averroism, had a significant impact 
on Islamic thought. Other scholars 
like Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd helped 
preserve and develop the works of 
Aristotle. Islamic scientists assimilated knowledge from various civilizations, including ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Indian, and 
Egyptian civilizations.

                    . They made advancements in fields such as geometry, astronomy, and mathematics. 
                    The famous mathematical equation 
                    of Algebra was developed by Persian scientist Muhammed Ibn Musa 
                    Al Khwarisimi. The term “Algebra” is 
                    derived from his name. Additionally, 
                    Ibn Al Haythm introduced the concept of the camera by studying how 
                    the human eye functions.
                    Medicine was also a specialized 
                    field during the Islamic Golden Age. 
                    Scholars translated medical texts 
                    from Sanskrit, Greek, and Syrian into 
                    Arabic, leading to the development 
                    of new medical science. This emphasis on medical knowledge reflected 
                    the importance of medicine in medieval Islamic culture. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the Islamic Golden Age 
was a time of immense progress and 
innovation in various fields. The contributions made by scholars during 
this period continue to influence and 
shape our world today. During the 
Islamic Golden Age, scholars made 
significant advancements in medicine, incorporating knowledge from 
various civilizations. This emphasis 
on medical knowledge reflected the 
importance of medicine in medieval 
Islamic culture. Medical texts from 
Sanskrit, Greek, and Syrian were 
translated into Arabic, leading to the 
development of new medical science. <br>
However, the ending of the Islamic Golden Age was marked by 
the Mongol invasion of Baghdad. 
The Mongols destroyed the entire 
city, including its libraries, and many 
scholars were killed in the attack. 
After the Mongols, the ruling power 
shifted to the Seljuks and then the 
Ottomans, who were not as interested in educational progress. Despite its importance, many historians have failed to acknowledge the 
contributions of Islamic civilizations 
during this golden age. The fear of 
mentioning Islam’s credits in the educational world has led to a lack of 
recognition for the developments 
made by Islamic scholars. However, 
it is important to recognize and appreciate the immense progress and 
innovation that occurred during this 
period. The contributions made by 
scholars during the Islamic Golden 
Age continue to influence and shape 
our world today

                    In brief, the Islamic Golden Age was 
                    a time of significant advancements in 
                    various fields such as economics, culture, and education in Islamic countries. The establishment of Baghdad 
                    as a center of trade and knowledge, 
                    the translation movement, and the 
                    assimilation of knowledge from various civilizations all contributed to 
                    the educational progress during this 
                    time. Despite the destruction caused 
                    by the Mongol invasion, it is crucial 
                    to acknowledge and appreciate the 
                    contributions made by Islamic scholars during this golden age.
