            Rise of Ottoman Empire</span >
        </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> There were many Muslim reformers in the world history. Including Umayyad Empire, Abbasid Empire, Seljuk Empire and Ottoman Empire. this essay is describing the great reformer of the world, Ottoman Empire. Once prophet Muhammed (PBUH) had said that, “one day Constantinople will come to the control of Muslims under the great commander of the world ever seen. His soldiers will be the most powerful soldiers of the world”. Yes this plea became true at the era of Ottoman Empire. The commander who conquered Constantinople (capital of Bizentain Empire) was Mohamed 2 (the conqueror) who is the 7th ruler (sulthan) of Ottoman empire. </p>
        <p class="blockquote">The beginning of Ottoman Empire</p>
        <p>       There were many examples of empires which became a great empire from a small tribe, just like Mongol empire, which was just a tribe under Genghis Khan, letter it became a great empire as a result of the heroism and transgressions of Genghis Khan and his followers. At the beginning, the Ottoman Empire was only a nomad Turk-tribe named as Kayi, which runs under Seljuk Empire.</p>
        <p>Osman Ghazi (Osman 1) who is known as the founder of Ottoman Empire was the leader of Kayi nomad tribe and a commander of Seljuk Empire. At the era of 1200, Seljuk Empire became weak as a result of subsequent transgressions by Mongol Empire and the complitment of Seljuk rulers with Mongol rulers it brought the maintenance of unity of Islam to the fore. While Osman Ghazi declared Kayi tribe as a regent, and he began to conquer the neighbor areas with handful soldiers. At last he nipped the Mongolians in the bud from his region. Gradually Kayi tribe became an empire.</p>
        <p>       The formal Ottoman Empire was centered in Anatolia. Anatolia continued as a capital of Ottoman Empire until they conquer Constantinople in 1402.

            Ottoman at its peak
            
                                  The empire continued its rise through many hands of empires. The troops first invented in Europe in 1345, sweeping the Balkans through the defeat of Timur. In 1402 Ottomans under sultan Mehmed (The conqueror) destroyed the byzantine back on the conquest of Constantinople (capital of the Byzantine Empire), now it is known as Istanbul.
            
                                   During the era of Selim 1(1512-1520) and his son Sulaiman (1520-1566), Ottoman Empire reached at its peak. Sulaiman took the control of parts of Persia, most of Arabia and a large section of Hungary and the Balkans.</p>
        <p>He conquered the parts of the Mamluk dynasty in Syria and Egypt on the 16th century; under Barbarossa which is the Navy force of the Ottoman Empire he conquered the Barbary Coast. Beginning with Selim, the Ottoman sultan also held the title of caliph which means the spiritual leader of Islam</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">Fall of Ottoman Empire</p>
        <p>      Ottoman forces repeatedly besieged Vienna, after their final effort the Austrian capital failed in 1683, and to subsequent losses led them to relinquish Hungary in 1699.

            In the 17th and 18th century the Russo-Turkish war and wars with Poland further weakened the empire. At last in 19th century the Europeans began to call Ottoman Empire as “sick man of Europe”. The remaining European territories are failed in Balkan wars (1912-1913).</p>
        <p>When World War 1 held on, Ottoman Empire decided to make an alliance with Germany to save the Muslim hostages from Russia. But Tripple Alliance was defeated in this war. This defeat led Ottoman Empire to many economic issues. Poverty spread in the country, meanwhile, the man named Mustafa Kamal Atatürk spread the ideas of a republic in the country to divert the people against the Sultanate of the Ottoman Empire. He tried to add fuel to fire with rude words and ideas against the Sultanate. As a result of his efforts, the sultanate was abolished in 1922.</p>
