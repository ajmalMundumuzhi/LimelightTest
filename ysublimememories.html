    <h2 class="read-head"><span>On The Sublime Memories Of Muharram</span></h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="read-content" style="text-align: justify;">Memories of Muharram never fade out, every Muharram Passes  its shining memories of eminent sacrifices, the lessons of which stay sublime for Muslim community, will be transmitted to the  coming generations for centuries. These historical memories were recalled in the context of  Muharram. The one who recalls these memories would share those memories to the next generation. Each and every Muharram is doors of era-births. So, it’s regarded as the starting of the year in lunar Hijri calendar. This Holy Month is also incorporated in  one of the War-prohibited months in Islam.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">The remarkable reminders</p>
    <p>      Nuh (A)’s Ark anchored at the mount Judi carrying many living organisms after the flood in the day of tenth Muharram. This is the initial reminder of Muharram. The day was a festive one. Nuh (A) said to the people with him: you are blessed with guidance. They prepared a feast with the dishes that were stored at the Ark. It was the first Festival at the earth after the flood.
        
                The heroic story of Banu Israel’s emancipation from the dictatorship of Pharaoh by the leadership of prophet Musa (A) is the second reminder of Muharram, When all the luxuries of his torturing Kingdom get perished between the wave series and whirls of Red sea.</p>
                <p>                    The third reminder of this holy month; the Pilgrimage and its consequence of prophet Muhammed (PBUH) and his companions from Makah. Those memories are relevant chapters in the history of Muharram.

                    By the last of sixth Hijri Year, Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) vested an Islamic system. Afterwards, The tactical move from Hussain (R) to protect the system of Prophet ended in a clash with Yazid which Killed above sixty from Prophet’s Family by the shore of Euphrates. This Tragic war (Karbala) attests the forth reminder of Muharram.</p>
                    <p class="blockquote">The Grandeur of Fast</p>
    <p>        Coaxing the readers to observance of prophet Muhammed (PBUH) Which ought to done and performed in the month of Allah (shahrullah); fasting by the penance from the desires of dunya and wicked sins.
        
        “After Ramadan, the noblest month to take fasting is the month of Allah (shahrullah) which you call Muharram, and the noblest prayer after farazh namaz is the prayer which performed at midnight.” [Reported by Muslim] 1163.</p>
        <p>This Hadith refers that the fasting is noble in the whole month of Muharram after Ramadan. Some months hold nobility for fasting in their some specific days including the day of Arafa, tenth day from Dhulhijja and six consecutive days after Eid-ul-fithr from the month Shawwal.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Thasua’h</p>
        <p>The ninth day from Muharram is generally termed as Thasua’h. like Muharram, this specific day has a great nobility. Our prophet Muhammed (PBUH) has proposed us to take fasting this day (Prophet Muhammed PBUH didn’t take fasting this day in his life).
            
            Abbas (R) has said that they (Swahaba) were taking fasting on the ninth and tenth days from Muharram [Reported by Thirmudhi].</p>
    <p>Ones Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) has Stated that “ if I live for the upcoming (year), I must take fasting on the ninth (from the month Muharram) [ Reported by Muslim] 1134.
        
        When someone heard about this statement, and them they questioned about the fasting of Prophet at Ninth and day (Swahaba) Replied many diverse answers.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">Ashura’h</p>
    <p>The tenth day from Muharram is generally termed as Ashura’h. Our Proophet (PBUH) has paid immense nobility for this day. Many Hadiths assure that our Prophet has paid attention for fasting in the month of Muharram after the Month of Ramadan.</p>
    <p>Once a man asked prophet Muhammed (PBUH): which month do you prefer for me to take fasting as observance. Then Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) replied that “take fasting in the month of Muharram. It’s the month of Allah (Shahrullah), in that month there is a day which Allah will give Atonement to a society and there is another day for giving atonement to another society”.</p>
    <p>Interpretation: this reasonly mentioned day is Ashura’h. Our Prophet Muhammed (PBUH)said that Muharram is the noblest month to take fasting after Ramadan. Because of this day involved in.</p>
    <p>Ibn Abbas (R) said: when Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) came to Madeena, He found that the Jews taking fasting in the tenth day of Muharram. He (PBUH) asked: what is this?They said that this is a good day on which Allah rescued Musa (A) and Banu-Israelites from the enemies (Thus Musa (A) took fasting that day),Then Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said that I’m more attached to Musa (A) than you.  Followingly, Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) took fasting that day and ordered us to take fasting [Reported by Bukhari].</p>
