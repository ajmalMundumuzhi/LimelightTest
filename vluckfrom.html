    <p class="read-content" style="text-align: justify;">Dayle was working in the area, cleaning the streets and waste baskets. 
        “Hey,” Jonny said. “Ah,” Dayle replied. “How is your work?” Jonny asked. 
        “It’s alright,” Dayle responded. 
        “My work is not going well. I took two days off, so the supervisor told me 
        to work two extra days without sleep. I’m leaving, I have another job waiting,” 
        said Dayle. Dayle quickly moved to his new workplace, carrying his phone 
        with him. He started his duties. Until 10 o’clock, he was fully occupied with 
        work. He then returned home, changed his clothes, and had a meal before 
        falling asleep.While he was working, Dayle noticed a basket with an electronic device inside. He took it and opened the device, finding an address along 
        with a note saying, “Come if you are a hard worker.” Dayle was intrigued by 
        this mysterious invitation. Why would someone write this note and throw 
        it away? What did they mean by asking him to come? Dayle pondered over 
        these questions as he slipped the letter into his pocket and went about his 
        day.
        Later, as Dayle lay on the ground, he realized it had all been a vivid dream. 
        “Hmm, what a dream,” he muttered, glancing at the clock. “I made it just in 
        time,” Dayle remarked. “Even today, I have only a few hours off.”
        Dayle changed his clothes and arrived at his workplace. He cleaned the 
        streets and emptied the garbage into the basket, which he then emptied 
        into a large hole. Miraculously, Dayle discovered another letter, identical to 
        the one in his dream, and promptly placed it in his pocket.In the evening, he 
        headed to the address written in the letter. It led him to a small hut, where 
        an elderly man was engrossed in a book. “Hello, sir. I’m the guest mentioned 
        in the letter. Is everything alright?” Dayle greeted.
        “Yes, you came here as instructed in the letter,” replied the old man. “Do 
        you recognize me? I am the president. I was away for 14 to 31 days and left 
        a letter in the basket. You are incredibly lucky. I am delighted. Now, tell me, 
        what can I offer you?” the President asked.
        Dayle responded, “I am grateful for this opportunity. I accept the job offer 
        and appreciate your generous offer of 50 percent of your savings.”
         After that, Dayle not only obtained the job but also became a billionaire.</p>
